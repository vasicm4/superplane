## On App Mention

The On App Mention trigger starts a workflow execution when the Slack app is mentioned in a message.

### Use Cases

- **Slash commands**: Process commands from Slack messages
- **Bot interactions**: Create interactive Slack bots
- **Team workflows**: Trigger workflows from Slack conversations
- **Notification processing**: Process and respond to mentions

### Configuration

- **Channel**: Optional channel filter - if specified, only mentions in this channel will trigger (leave empty to listen to all channels)

### Event Data

Each mention event includes:
- **event**: Event information including message text, channel, and timestamp
- **user**: User who mentioned the app
- **channel**: Channel where the mention occurred
- **text**: The message text containing the mention

### Setup

This trigger automatically sets up a Slack event subscription when configured. The subscription is managed by SuperPlane and will be cleaned up when the trigger is removed.

{
  "data": {
    "api_app_id": "A123ABC456",

### Configuration

### Notes

- The Slack app must be installed and have permission to post to the selected channel

### Example Output

```json
{
  "data": {
    "channel": "C123456",

## Wait for Button Click

The Wait for Button Click component sends a message to a Slack channel or DM with interactive buttons and waits for the user to click one of the configured buttons.

### Use Cases

- **Request approval or input**: Get structured input from a user in Slack before applying or deploying (e.g., Approve / Reject buttons)
- **Pause a workflow**: Wait until a human selects an option (e.g., Confirm / Cancel)
- **Implement slash-command style flows**: Create interactive flows that need a structured reply via buttons

### Configuration

- **Channel**: Slack channel or DM channel name to post to (required)
- **Message**: Message text (supports Slack formatting, required)
- **Timeout**: Maximum time to wait in seconds (optional)
- **Buttons**: Set of 1–4 items, each with name (label) and value (required)

### Output Channels

- **Received**: Emits when the user clicks a button; payload includes the selected value and clicker info (when available)
- **Timeout**: Emits when no button click is received within the configured timeout

### Behavior

- The message is posted with interactive buttons
- The workflow pauses until a button is clicked or timeout occurs
- Only the first button click is processed; subsequent clicks are ignored
- If timeout is not configured, the component waits indefinitely

### Notes

- The Slack app must be installed and have permission to post to the selected channel
- Supports Slack markdown formatting in message text
- Button clicks are processed through Slack's interactive components API

### Example Output

```json
{
  "data": {
    "clicked_at": "2026-02-10T21:00:00Z",
    "clicked_by": {
      "id": "U01234567",
      "username": "pedro"
    },
    "value": "approve"
  },
  "timestamp": "2026-02-10T21:00:00Z",
  "type": "slack.button.clicked"
}
```
